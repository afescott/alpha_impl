# Liquidations - Tier 3
It’s DeFi Summer, and you run one of the most successful liquidators on Compound v2. On August 20, 2020, you realize that you are losing market share to [this address](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xec4f2ab36afa4fac4ba79b1ca67165c61c62c3bb6a18271c18f42a6bdfdb533d). This is odd because you updated the trading setup after [this proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/19), and have consistently won almost all liquidations since then.


- a) What’s the edge of this liquidator that allows them to win more liquidations?
- b) When you figure out the source of the edge, you notice that their calldata is extremely obfuscated. Can you explain on how the calldata works?
- c) Write code for the bot in Solidity, and provide all necessary information to simulate this liquidation on a mainnet fork.
