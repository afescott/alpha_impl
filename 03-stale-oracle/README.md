# Stale-Oracle - Tier 1
While digging around, you learn about the manual process involved in updating oracle prices for [Compound v1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fda67f7583380e67ef93072294a7fac882fd7e7). According to the official blog post, the protocol was deprecated on June 3, 2019. However, according to the contract, it was never paused, and there are no functions for freezing markets. Given this, perhaps itâ€™s possible to use stale prices and borrow all assets cheaply?


- a) Are the prices stale according to the view of Compound v1?
- b) Were markets paused in some way? Provide all necessary data to simulate the borrowing of any asset on June 5, 2019 to prove your point.
